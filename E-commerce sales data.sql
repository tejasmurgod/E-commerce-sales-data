-- Created a sales table with customer, agent, product, and service interaction details.

-- Performed data cleaning: handled NULLs, standardized casing, removed duplicates, and flagged outliers.

-- Analyzed CSAT performance across channels, agents, shifts, and tenure buckets.

-- Derived business insights like top revenue categories, response time averages, busiest cities/days, and top-performing agents.

-- Identified supervisors, cities, and product categories driving revenue or variance, making the dataset ready for deeper business decisions.
